# 🚀 TimePilot — Your Personal Mission Control for the Day

**TimePilot** is a web app dashboard designed to help you manage your day like a commander running mission control. Instead of a boring to-do list, TimePilot turns your schedule into a **launch timeline**, your tasks into **missions**, and your focus time into a **controlled deep-work operation**.

This project blends the feel of a **NASA control room**, an **indie productivity zine**, and slightly imperfect **human-centered design** — avoiding the cold, corporate SaaS look.

---

## 🧭 Concept

> **Theme:** *You are the commander of today.*

TimePilot reframes productivity as **mission planning**, helping users:

* See their day as a structured timeline
* Manage workload before burnout happens
* Enter deep focus mode without distractions
* Learn patterns from past performance

It’s not about doing *more* — it’s about running your day with clarity and intention.

## 🖥 Core Features

### 🛰 Mission Timeline (Task Schedule)

A vertical, launch-style timeline showing your daily missions:

* Task name and time window
* Duration badge (e.g., **45m**)
* Priority status:

  * **CRITICAL**
  * **STANDARD**
  * **LOW ORBIT**
* Active tasks glow like a radar lock

---

### 🚨 Incoming Signals (Smart Reminders)

Instead of generic notifications, reminders appear as **mission alerts**:

* 🟡 **T-120 min** – Prep warning
* 🟠 **T-30 min** – Wrap-up alert
* 🔴 **T-0** – Mission start

These alerts help users transition smoothly between tasks instead of being abruptly interrupted.

---

### 🧠 Capacity Check (Overload Detector)

A system diagnostic panel that compares:
**Available Time vs Planned Time**

If the day is overloaded, TimePilot suggests offloading low-priority missions.

**Example message:**

> “You scheduled 8h 30m into a 5h window. Recommend offloading 2 low-priority tasks.”

---

### ⚡ Crew Energy Status

Users can set their current energy level:

* **Low Power**
* **Steady**
* **Full Charge**

This helps align task difficulty with mental capacity.

---

### 🎯 Focus Lock Mode

A full-screen deep work overlay that activates during important missions.

Includes:

* Large countdown timer
* Current mission name
* Subtle radar sweep animation
* System message:

  > “Distractions muted. You’re cleared for deep work.”

---

### 📊 Mission Logs (Insights Page)

TimePilot tracks patterns and shows insights like:

* Most productive hour
* Delay patterns
* Completion streaks

Styled like control station data logs — minimal, readable, and human.

## 🎨 Design System

TimePilot avoids generic productivity app visuals.

**Color Palette**

* Background: Deep charcoal with green undertone
* Urgent: Burnt orange
* Standard: Dusty teal
